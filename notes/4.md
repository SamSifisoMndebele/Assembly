# Direct Memory Operands

* A direct memory operand is a named reference to storage in memory
* The named reference (label) is automatically dereferenced by the assembler

```asm
.data
var1 BYTE 10h

.code
    mov al, var1         ; AL = 10h
    mov al, [var1]       ; alternative notation
```

# Direct-Offset Operands
* A constant offset is added to a data label to produce an effective address (EA). 
* The address is dereferenced to get the value inside its memory location.
```asm
.data
arrayB BYTE 10h,20h,30h,40h

.code
    mov al, arrayB+1     ; AL = 20h
    mov al, [arrayB+1]   ; alternative notation
```
```asm
.data
arrayW  WORD 1000h,2000h,3000h
arrayD  DWORD 1,2,3,4

.code
    mov ax,[arrayW+2]		; AX = 2000h
    mov ax,[arrayW+4]		; AX = 3000h
    mov eax,[arrayD+4]		; EAX = 00000002h
```
```asm
; Will the following statements assemble?
mov ax,[arrayW-2]		; ??
mov eax,[arrayD+16]		; ??
```



# `MOV` Instruction
* Move from source to destination. Syntax:
* MOV destination,source
* No more than one memory operand permitted
* CS, EIP, and IP cannot be the destination
* No immediate to segment moves

```asm
.data
count BYTE 100
wVal  WORD 2

.code
    mov bl,count
    mov ax,wVal
    mov count,al

    mov al,wVal         ; error
    mov ax,count        ; error
    mov eax,count       ; error
```

## Zero Extension
When you copy a smaller value into a larger destination, the `MOVZX` instruction fills (extends) the upper half of the destination with zeros.
```asm
mov bl,10001111b
movzx ax,bl         ; zero-extension
```
## Sign Extension
The `MOVSX` instruction fills the upper half of the destination with a copy of the source operand's sign bit.
```asm
mov bl,10001111b
movsx ax,bl         ; sign extension
```

# `XCHG` Instruction
* `XCHG` exchanges the values of two operands. At least one operand must be a register. No immediate operands are permitted.

```asm
.data
var1 WORD 1000h
var2 WORD 2000h

.code
    xchg ax,bx      ; exchange 16-bit regs
    xchg ah,al      ; exchange 8-bit regs
    xchg var1,bx    ; exchange mem, reg
    xchg eax,ebx    ; exchange 32-bit regs

    xchg var1,var2  ; error: two memory operands
```
